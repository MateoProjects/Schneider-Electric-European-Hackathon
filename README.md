# Schneider-Electric-European-Hackathon
Schneider Electric European Hackathon - Data ScienceZero deforestation mission 19 Nov 2022

## Description of the challenge

The challenge consists of developing an image classification model in order to predict the type of deforestation in a satelital image. And the final goal of the model is to detect early the problem and perform actions to protect the lands. Apart from the satellite images, we have the coordinate of the image taken and its year.
To get the maximum score, the team participants have to present their code, the prediction results of their model and a presentation explaining the challenge, how they have approached the problem and why.

## What we do

We made an analysis of the data to understand what correlation there may be with it's type of deforestation. Subsequently, the first models have been made to see what the current state is, to see how complicated the task is and in order to have the first version of the complete flow. Finally, improvements have been made such as DataAugmentation and TransferLearning together with the validation of the results.
